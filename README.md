# Summary
This script is intended to allow you to move your mouse, type, play/pause, 
change volume, among other things, all with the use of an XBOX controller.

You can change the bindings to your liking in buttonBindings, as well as other settings.

The original idea with this was to create something I could use as a TV remote,
since the TV in my dorm was connected to my PC. I hope you can find other uses.
If you have any issues or feature ideas, raise an issue on github or email me at

# Installation and Usage

This program runs using two python packages, pynput and inputs.
You can enter the following commands with bash or the terminal 

>pip install inputs

>pip install pynput

After these have installed, run main.py with python 2.9 or newer.
If your controller is connected, try moving a stick or pressing a button.
The controller status should appear in the window.

# Changing settings

You can change the bindings of the remote by modifying the variables in buttonBindings.py.
Check out the links for specific keys. If you want to link it to just a character,
simply type 'a', or 'b'.
